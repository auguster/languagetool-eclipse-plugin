languagetool-eclipse-plugin
===========================
It started as a weekend project while writing my PhD Thesis: a simple Eclipse plugin providing grammar checking using [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org).

I couldn't find the time to work on it ever since. Hopefully, VogellaCompany took over the project.

Please, feel free to contribute there: https://github.com/vogellacompany/languagetool-eclipse-plugin

Best regards,
